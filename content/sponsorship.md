    <p>For the past nine years, we’ve held Exeter’s only grass-roots tech conference, a sell-out event which attracts local and national speakers across a broad range of themes for our ever expanding tech & digital community.</p>
    <p>We're a not-for-profit community interest company - your sponsorship monies go directly into helping us to put on events like this - we don't take a salary!</p>
    <blockquote>“It's great that the Tech Exeter Conference has started from a grassroots level and is now a pull for developers from across the South West”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Myself and fellow intern learnt lots about tech businesses, marketing and more which we can carry forward with us in our future careers! Was a great day meeting such talented professionals!”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Thanks again to you & the team for arranging yesterday. What a great group & incredibly engaging talks”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“My organisation (NHS Digital) and myself needs to be more involved in the TechExeter scene, I think it is really great to see this stuff going on”</blockquote>
