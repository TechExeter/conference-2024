The National Museum of Computing, based at Bletchley Park, is home to the world's largest collection of working historic computers. Version 1 worked with the Museum to co-create a ChatGPT enabled guide to exhibits. We take account of visitor ability, computing knowledge, general age band (child or adult), neuro-diversity requirements and first language. 

We present visitors with tailored exhibit explanations which enhances their museum experience. We'll share the life journey of the project, why we did this, what it means to the museum and visitors, and how we achieved it. Join us for this innovative use of emerging AI technology.
