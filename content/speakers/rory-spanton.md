Millions of people are misjudged by banks every year when applying for credit. Financial organisations often make poor decisions about individuals with limited credit histories, denying financially capable people credit, and lending to those who present hidden risks.

Good With uses data science to give lenders better information about these “credit invisibles”, promoting fairer access to finance for all. Crucially, this includes psychological data and insights from behavioural science in conjunction with banking data. In this talk, I discuss our approach to behavioural data science, and how we apply it to modelling financial health.
