In 2021, SWGfL and Meta partnered to launch a platform to hash user's intimate images to prevent them from being uploaded to social media platforms.

Now in 2024 we have 800k hashes, and partner with multiple social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, OnlyFans, PornHub and more, as well as 100+ NGO's around the world to prevent the spread of NCII.

This is an engineers presentation of the platform, how it works, some of the challenges we have faced, and what the future holds.
