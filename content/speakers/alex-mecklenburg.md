## Takeover Theme: Responsible Technology - beyond buzzword and towards a concrete business consideration

Responsible technology has outgrown the ‘buzzword’ stage and is becoming a concrete business consideration across sectors and industries. Research conducted by MIT and  Thoughtworks in 2023 showed nearly three-quarters of survey respondents either strongly agree (30%) or somewhat agree (43%) that “responsible technology considerations will eventually come to equal business or financial considerations in importance when organisations make decisions about technology use.

The most cited hurdles to adoption of responsible technology are a lack of senior management awareness (52%), organisational resistance to change (46%), and internal competing priorities (46%).

What the research also showed was that the definition of responsible technology varies across organisations and that there is currently no consensus on which responsible practices should take priority in organisations. 

## Session 2: Workshop

In the second session, we will host a workshop that facilitates the use of the Consequence Scanning tool to explore the consequences of technology choices and processes, providing participants with an opportunity to reflect on both intended and unintended outcomes.
