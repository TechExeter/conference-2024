## Takeover Theme: Responsible Technology - beyond buzzword and towards a concrete business consideration

Responsible technology has outgrown the ‘buzzword’ stage and is becoming a concrete business consideration across sectors and industries. Research conducted by MIT and  Thoughtworks in 2023 showed nearly three-quarters of survey respondents either strongly agree (30%) or somewhat agree (43%) that “responsible technology considerations will eventually come to equal business or financial considerations in importance when organisations make decisions about technology use.

The most cited hurdles to adoption of responsible technology are a lack of senior management awareness (52%), organisational resistance to change (46%), and internal competing priorities (46%).

What the research also showed was that the definition of responsible technology varies across organisations and that there is currently no consensus on which responsible practices should take priority in organisations. 

## Workshop

Our panelists will be joining us for a workshop as a second session. 

A practical and highly interactive workshop that introduces Consequence Scanning as an agile business practice to focus on the positive aspects of a product or decision and mitigate or address potential harms or disasters before they happen. Participants will learn about the process and will have the opportunity to experience an adaptable and lightweight practice to take back into their own communities and organisations.
