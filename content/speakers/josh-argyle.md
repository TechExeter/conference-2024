Answering complex financial queries requires a deep understanding of evolving financial concepts and relationships. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fall short in such specialized domains due to their limited ability to capture domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we propose an enhanced RAG system that integrates a dynamic financial knowledge graph with a language model for more accurate and efficient financial document processing.

Our approach involves constructing a continuously evolving knowledge graph tailored to the financial domain, capturing intricate relationships and terminology. We introduce a two-stage alignment process: first, we link broad concepts from the query to the document graph using heuristic methods and graph neural networks; second, we refine this alignment through semantic matching techniques to ensure precise correspondence between query specifics and document elements. An integrated language model then extracts and structures the relevant financial data according to user-defined output specifications.

User feedback is integral to our system, continuously refining the knowledge graph and improving alignment with the users expectations. By enhancing the RAG system with knowledge graph reasoning, our method outperforms traditional RAG systems in financial data retrieval tasks. Additionally, it provides interpretable reasoning paths and transparency in the information retrieval process.
