"Digital twins have been defined as virtual models of existing products or systems able to exchange information between the real and virtual representation for purposes of parameters estimation, uncertainty reduction, scenario planning, decision-making support and control.

The ever-increasing deployment of DERs will require of faster decision making and control to optimally utilise their stochastic generation nature.
Digital twins within the energy grid promise to optimally utilise current grid infrastructure to keep the rollout of renewable and low carbon technologies in a safe, efficient and fair manner."
