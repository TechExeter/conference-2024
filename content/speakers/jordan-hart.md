The data ""explosion"" of the past two decades has been hailed as a revolution, yet many organisations find themselves sitting on vast piles of data without really knowing what to do with it. This session explores the gap between data abundance and the availability of tools to make the most of it.

We'll examine why common machine learning methods often fall short when applied to decision-making processes, how machine learning validation can fail, and  and why chucking all your data into an LLM won’t help either!. Drawing on real-world examples from our work at Causa, we'll introduce the concepts of causal AI and decision theory, and show how they can make a difference to decision-making in the real world.

By the end of this session, (hopefully) you’ll have a clearer understanding of the challenges in translating data into actionable decisions and the potential of causal AI to address these challenges.
