takeaways:
- What are APIs
- What is OAuth 2.0
- How best to use OAuth 2.0 to protect your APIs
---

Public-facing APIs are fundamental to enabling distributed solutions incorporating Mobile apps, Single-Page Applications, etc. But how do you know whoâ€™s calling your API? And more importantly, how do you know exactly what access that caller should be allowed? Sure, API Keys offer one possible solution. But theyâ€™re not particularly flexible, and managing them/protecting them can be a challenge! 

If you build public-facing APIs as part of your app development, then Iâ€™ll show you why leveraging OAuth 2.0 as part of a Customer Identity solution is altogether the better choice ðŸ˜Ž
