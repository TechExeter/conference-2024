takeaways:
- Overview of support for AI tools in Uni education
---

Students at University have seen the impact that LLMs and other AI tools have had on how they can produce work for assessment. A number are concerned - quite rightfully - that they could be doing the “wrong thing”.

We know that collaboration and peer discussion is crucial to help students learn and to take their place in the ever moving tech environment.  The issue for us as educators is how to make sure that can happen without infringing plagiarism rules and ensuring the work is authentically that of the student submitting. 

This talk illustrates how the faculty here at Exeter are setting out to support and encourage the use of AI tools ethically and appropriately.
