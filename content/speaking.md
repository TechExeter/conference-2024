<li>We welcome non-technical talks, but our focus is science / tech / engineering / art / math (STEAM)</li>
<li>Returning speakers are welcome</li>
<li>You can submit multiple talks</li>
<li>Get paid £ to speak (see below)</li>
<li>Not sure about speaking? Why not give it a shot anyway! We have 3 tracks of talks to fill, plus monthly meetup events, so we need your submissions!</li>

<h2>Am I techy enough? / I haven’t done this before …</h2>

<p>Short answer: You are techy enough, and you can do this!</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>If you have a passion about a topic, whatever experience level, then we want to hear from you. <br/>
  If you haven’t done this before then we can help. We can review your slides, help with individual presentation styles and formats, and make sure you are fully prepared.
</p>

<h2>Get paid? What?!</h2>

<p>That’s right – we value our speakers time and will pay for you to speak at this event!</p>

<p>Everyone receives the same flat fee (the exact amount will be determined based on ticket sales and sponsorship monies raised) – you can spend this on travel / accomodation / whatever you want!</p>
